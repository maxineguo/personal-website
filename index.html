        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>
            Hello! My name is Maxine Guo. I am a 12 year old middle schooler at Peterson Middle School with a passion for media literacy and computer science. I have some experience in Python programming. In my free time, I enjoy coding, learning some hardware, and playing viola. Currently, I'm working on a project for the Congressional App Challenge called DeBunk'D. I am also a member of Hack Club. I'm always looking for new challenges and opportunities to learn and grow.
